Absolutely, Somto! Here's the **`README.md`** file summarizing everything weâ€™ve built for Roxi so far.

# The Roxi Project

## Overview
**Roxi** is an intelligent automated system designed to simulate reconnaissance, decision-making, weaponization, delivery, persistence, and feedback refinement. Built as a modular framework, Roxi adapts based on live results and grows smarter over time.

---

## **Features**
1. **Reconnaissance and Decision Engine**:
   - Scans targets for open ports and services.
   - Generates decisions based on detected services (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.).
   - Outputs decisions to `decision_log.json` for further processing.

2. **Weaponization Module**:
   - Matches decisions with vulnerabilities or exploits (mock data used for now).
   - Generates weaponization tasks, including prepared payloads, and saves them to `weaponization_tasks.json`.

3. **Delivery Module**:
   - Executes delivery tasks such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP probes, or mock payload delivery.
   - Logs delivery results in `delivery_log.json`.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Refines decisions based on delivery outcomes (success/failure).
   - Updates decision priorities dynamically and saves refined decisions in `refined_decision_log.json`.

5. **Persistence Simulation**:
   - Simulates maintaining access via mock backdoors and session tracking.
   - Saves persistence results in `persistence_log.json`.

## **Modules Overview**

### **1. Decision Engine (`decision_engine.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Processes scan results, generates decisions based on open ports and services.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - `decision_log.json` contains generated decisions.
  - `refined_decision_log.json` contains dynamically adjusted priorities.

### **2. Weaponization (`weaponization.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Matches decisions with vulnerabilities (using mock CVE database) to generate actionable tasks.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - `weaponization_tasks.json` contains prepared payloads and target information.

### **3. Delivery Module (`delivery.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Executes delivery tasks like HTTP GET requests, FTP probing, SMTP testing, and Telnet connection.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - `delivery_log.json` contains results of delivery tasks.

### **4. Feedback Loop (`feedback.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Refines decisions based on success/failure of delivery tasks.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - `refined_decision_log.json` contains updated decisions.

### **5. Persistence Simulation (`persistence.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Simulates maintaining access via backdoors and session tracking.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - `persistence_log.json` contains persistence results.
  - `sessions.json` tracks simulated active sessions.

### **6. Monitoring (`monitor.py`)**

- **Purpose**: Real-time log monitoring for delivery tasks.
- **Key Outputs**:
  - Live streaming console output (tracked in `delivery_log.json`).

## **How to Run**

1. **Start the Decision Engine**:

   ```bash
   python modules/decision_engine.py
   ```
2. **Generate Weaponization Tasks**:

   ```bash
   python modules/weaponization.py
   ```
3. **Execute Delivery Tasks**:

   ```bash
   python modules/delivery.py
   ```
4. **Run Feedback Refinement**:

   ```bash
   python modules/feedback.py
   ```
5. **Simulate Persistence**:

   ```bash
   python modules/persistence/persistence.py
   ```
6. **Monitor Logs in Real-Time**:

   ```bash
   python modules/monitoring/monitor.py
   ```

---

## **Future Development**

- **Dynamic CVE Database Integration**:

  - Connect Roxi to a live CVE database for real-world weaponization tasks.
