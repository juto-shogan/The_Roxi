# The Roxi Project

## Overview
**Roxi** is an intelligent automated system designed to simulate reconnaissance, decision-making, weaponization, delivery, persistence, and feedback refinement. Built as a modular framework, Roxi adapts based on live results and grows smarter over time.

---

## **Features**
1. **Reconnaissance and Decision Engine**:
   - Scans targets for open ports and services.
   - Generates decisions based on detected services (e.g., HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.).
   - Outputs decisions to `decision_log.json` for further processing.

2. **Weaponization Module**:
   - Matches decisions with vulnerabilities or exploits (mock data used for now).
   - Generates weaponization tasks, including prepared payloads, and saves them to `weaponization_tasks.json`.

3. **Delivery Module**:
   - Executes delivery tasks such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, SMTP probes, or mock payload delivery.
   - Logs delivery results in `delivery_log.json`.

4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Refines decisions based on delivery outcomes (success/failure).
   - Updates decision priorities dynamically and saves refined decisions in `refined_decision_log.json`.

5. **Persistence Simulation**:
   - Simulates maintaining access via mock backdoors and session tracking.
   - Saves persistence results in `persistence_log.json`.

  - Stores the data in an SQLite database with structured tables.
  - Progress is being tracked, with data processing currently underway.
